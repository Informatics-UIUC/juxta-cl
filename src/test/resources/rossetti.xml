               <salute>Dear William,</salute>
            </opener>
                <p n="1">I have been thinking whether Brussels offers materials for a sonnet, but have
                    come to the conclusion that not even thus much is to be got out of its utter
                    muffishness. I will therefore fill this last column with as much prose as I can
                    afford you. However, the verse must stand for a letter this time: though, with
                    the exception of two or three of the sonnets, I fear it is not even so good as
                    what I have already sent you. The fact is a journey in fair &amp; foul weather are
                    two very different things, and the verse gets its measure of <hi rend="u">
                  <foreign lang="italian">estro</foreign>
               </hi> accordingly.
                    But I will not grunt about past evils, for the weather, these days in Brussels,
                    has been like the finest summer.</p>
                <p n="2">There is a most servile aping of the French here, notwithstanding that they seem
                    to be held in hatred. The English are victimized to a beastly extent everywhere.
                    One of the great nuisances of this place, as also at Waterloo, is the plague of
                    guides from which there is no escape. The one we had at Waterloo completely
                    baulked me of all the sonnets I had promised myself; so that all I accomplished
                    was the embryo bottled up in the preceding column. Between you and me, William,
                    Waterloo is simply a bore.</p>
                <p n="3">I believe we saw all the town to day, except a lot of scientific and industrial
                    silliness, and one room at the Museum which we perceived was full of Rubenses
                    and so held aloof. There are a few very fine early German pictures, among them a
                    wonderful Van Eyck. I believe we shall see no end of these stunning things at
                    Antwerp, Ghent, &amp;c. and as I am convinced they will drag me into rhyme,
                    I almost fear that I shall not do much, if anything, to Bride Chamber Talk, till
                    my return. Before leaving Paris, we went to the Hotel de Cluny, a first-rate
                    place, which will be of great use to me in finishing this poem. Could I do it on
                    the spot, I fancy I should be a made man. I fear there is no chance now of going
                    to Brittany.</p>
                <p n="4">All further matters concerning your poem we can discuss on my return, which will
                    be much shorter work. I will only mention one thing which I forgot to include in
                    my last. I think the penultimate line of the poem would perhaps be more forcible
                    if it stood thus: “I can wait, John, but is not <hi rend="u">the whole</hi> due?”</p>

               <note>It seems WMR added square brackets around a reference to Nussey that he wished later to exclude.</note>
            </pageheader>
                <p n="5">You can have no conception of the intense sweating exasperation incident on
                    passport-hunting. We had three days of it before leaving Paris.</p>
                <p n="6">You talk about printing my blessed journal. I fear this would never do: there is
                    too much of a kind of exclusive matter belonging only to ourselves; and
                    moreover, among the things I have written since leaving London, there are only
                    3 sonnets which have received any consideration: viz: the 2 on Ingres'
                    picture &amp; the one on the road to Waterloo—all in the present letter.</p>
                <p n="7">I believe it is very probable that you will receive before my return a large
                    volume of old Charivaris containing Gavarni's sketches, which I left with
                    Broadie at Paris, to be bound and forwarded to you, in order to escape paying
                    double duty both in Belgium &amp; England. They will be bound anyhow, provisorily,
                    merely that they may go in the book form, and not have to pay 1<hi rend="sup">d</hi> apiece, as
                    prints, at the Custom House.</p>
                <p n="8">Of the 2 prospectuses you sent me, I gave one to Broadie, and the other has
                    somehow got all covered with ink. I must therefore let the sending to Lyell &amp;
                    Cottingham stand over for the present. We can discuss advertising at length when
                    we are all together. I quite agree with you about the inadvisability of getting
                    any more proprietors as yet. <add>[</add>Nussey is certainly a man I should not wish to
                    include, as I suspect he is rather fidgetty &amp; obstinate, &amp; also
                    that his genius as a writer is not overpowering<add>]</add>. It appears to me quite
                    unnecessary to begin sending about prospectuses at present in any great
                    quantity.</p>
                <p n="9">You speak of the uncertainty of Haynes' estimate coinciding with Tupper's. If
                    Tupper is more moderate, let us print by all means with him.</p>
                <p n="10">Will you tell Papa that while in Paris I called with his letter for Ronna at the
                    address which it bears, and saw a crusty old woman who said he had been gone
                    some time and she did not know whither, but that if I called next day perhaps
                    someone would be there who knew. The quarter of Paris, however, was one we never
                    had occasion to be in, &amp; which is infamously paved. The consequence was
                    that we put off calling again till it was too late. Owing to the number of
                    things we were obliged to run after, several other letters with which we had
                    been entrusted shared the same fate.</p>
                <p n="11">To Papa, Mamma, &amp; Collinson, I intend to write as soon as possible. I
                    hope they have made allowances hitherto. A letter is also due to Christina which
                    still lies unattempted. I have likewise to answer Woolner, and to redeem my
                    promise to Hancock.</p>
                <p n="12">Write at once, and if you have done anything send it: if not, something of
                    Christina's. Remember me warmly to all friends, who, by my good fortune, are too
                    numerous to particularize. I trust Papa's health holds good. By the bye, I hear
                    nothing of the Bermondsey murder.</p>
