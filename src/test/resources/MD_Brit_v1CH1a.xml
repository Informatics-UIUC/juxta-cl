<head>THE WHALE.<lb/>
CHAPTER I.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">loomings</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Call</hi> me Ishmael. Some years ago&#x2014;never mind<lb/>
how long precisely&#x2014;having little or no money in<lb/>
my purse, and nothing particular to interest me<lb/>
on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and<lb/>
see the watery part of the world. It is a way I<lb/>
have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the<lb/>
circulation. Whenever I find myself growing<lb/>
grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp,<lb/>
drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find<lb/>
myself involuntarily pausing before coffin ware-<lb/>
houses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral<lb/>
I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get<lb/>
such an upper hand of me that it requires a strong<lb/>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately<lb/>
stepping into the street, and methodically knoc-<lb/>
king people&#x0027;s hats off&#x2014;then, I account it high time<lb/>
to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substi-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n19" n="2"/>
tute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical<lb/>
flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I<lb/>
quietly take to the ship. There is nothing sur-<lb/>
prising in this. If they but knew it, almost all<lb/>
men in their degree, some time or other, cherish<lb/>
very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean<lb/>
with me.</p>
<p>There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes,<lb/>
belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral<lb/>
reefs&#x2014;commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right<lb/>
and left the streets take you waterward. Its ex-<lb/>
treme down-town is the Battery, where that noble<lb/>
mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes,<lb/>
which a few hours previous were out of sight of<lb/>
land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.</p>
<p>Circumambulate the city on a dreamy Sabbath<lb/>
afternoon; go from Corlears Hook to Coenties<lb/>
Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward.<lb/>
What do you see? Posted like silent sentinels all<lb/>
around the town, stand thousands upon thousands<lb/>
of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries; some lean-<lb/>
ing against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-<lb/>
heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships<lb/>
from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if<lb/>
striving to get a still better seaward peep. But<lb/>
these are all landsmen; of week-days pent up in<lb/>
lath and plaster &#x2014; tied to counters, nailed to<lb/>
benches, clinched to desks. How then is this?<lb/>
Are the green fields gone? What do they here?</p>
<pb xml:id="n20" n="3"/>
<p>But look! here come more crowds, pacing<lb/>
straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a<lb/>
dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but<lb/>
the extremest limit of the land: loitering under<lb/>
the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice.<lb/>
No. They must get just as nigh the water as they<lb/>
possibly can without falling in. And there they<lb/>
stand&#x2014;miles of them&#x2014;leagues. Inlanders all,<lb/>
they come from lanes and alleys, streets and<lb/>
avenues&#x2014;north, east, south, and west. Yet here<lb/>
they all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue<lb/>
in the needles of the compasses of all those ships<lb/>
attract them thither?</p>
<p>Once more. Say, you are in the country; in<lb/>
some high land of lakes. Take almost any path<lb/>
you please, and ten to one it carries you down in<lb/>
a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the<lb/>
stream. There is magic in it. Let the most<lb/>
absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest<lb/>
reveries&#x2014;stand that man on his legs, set his feet<lb/>
a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if<lb/>
water there be in all that region. Should you<lb/>
ever be athirst in the great American desert, try<lb/>
this experiment, if your caravan happen to be sup-<lb/>
plied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every<lb/>
one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.</p>
<p>But here is an artist. He desires to paint you<lb/>
the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n21" n="4"/>
bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the<lb/>
Saco. What is the chief element he employs?<lb/>
There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk,<lb/>
as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and<lb/>
here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle;<lb/>
and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke.<lb/>
Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way,<lb/>
reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed<lb/>
in their hill-side blue. But though the picture<lb/>
lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes<lb/>
down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd&#x0027;s<lb/>
head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd&#x0027;s eye<lb/>
were fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go<lb/>
visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on<lb/>
scores of miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-<lb/>
lilies&#x2014;what is the one charm wanting?&#x2014;Water&#x2014;<lb/>
there is not a drop of water there! Were Nia-<lb/>
gara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your<lb/>
thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet<lb/>
of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls<lb/>
of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat,<lb/>
which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a<lb/>
pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is<lb/>
almost every robust healthy boy with a robust<lb/>
healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy<lb/>
to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a<lb/>
passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical<lb/>
vibration, when first told that you and your ship<lb/>
were now out of sight of land? Why did the old<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n22" n="5"/>
Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks<lb/>
give it a separate deity, and make him the own<lb/>
brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without<lb/>
meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that<lb/>
story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp<lb/>
the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain,<lb/>
plunged into it and was drowned. But that same<lb/>
image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans.<lb/>
It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life;<lb/>
and this is the key to it all.</p>
<p>Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going<lb/>
to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy about the<lb/>
eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs,<lb/>
I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go<lb/>
to sea as a passenger. For to go as a passenger<lb/>
you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a<lb/>
rag unless you have something in it. Besides,<lb/>
passengers get sea-sick&#x2014;grow quarrelsome&#x2014;don&#x0027;t<lb/>
sleep of nights&#x2014;do not enjoy themselves much, as<lb/>
a general thing;&#x2014;no, I never go as a passenger;<lb/>
nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go<lb/>
to sea as a commodore, or a captain, or a cook.<lb/>
I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices<lb/>
to those who like them. For my part, I abomi-<lb/>
nate all honourable respectable toils, trials, and<lb/>
tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is quite<lb/>
as much as I can do to take care of myself, with-<lb/>
out taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners,<lb/>
and what not. And as for going as cook,&#x2014;though<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n23" n="6"/>
I confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook<lb/>
being a sort of officer on ship-board&#x2014;yet, some-<lb/>
how, I never fancied broiling fowls;&#x2014;though once<lb/>
broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically<lb/>
salted and peppered, there is no one who will<lb/>
speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially,<lb/>
of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of the<lb/>
idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon<lb/>
broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see<lb/>
the mummies of those creatures in their huge<lb/>
bake-houses, the pyramids.</p>
<p>No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor,<lb/>
right before the mast, plumb down into the fore-<lb/>
castle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True,<lb/>
they rather order me about, and make me jump<lb/>
from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May<lb/>
meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is un-<lb/>
pleasant enough. It touches one&#x0027;s sense of honour,<lb/>
particularly if you come of an old-established<lb/>
family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or Ran-<lb/>
dolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if<lb/>
just previous to putting your hand into the tar-<lb/>
pot, you have been lording it as a country school-<lb/>
master, making the tallest boys stand in awe of<lb/>
you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you<lb/>
&#x2014;from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a<lb/>
strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to ena-<lb/>
ble you to grin and bear it. But even this wears<lb/>
off in time.</p>
<pb xml:id="n24" n="7"/>
<p>What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain<lb/>
orders me to get a broom and sweep down the<lb/>
decks? What does that indignity amount to&#x2014;<lb/>
weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testa-<lb/>
ment? Who is not a slave? Tell me that. Well,<lb/>
then, however the old sea-captains may order me<lb/>
about&#x2014;however they may thump and punch me<lb/>
about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is<lb/>
all right; that everybody else is one way or other<lb/>
served in much the same way, either in a physical<lb/>
or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the<lb/>
universal thump is passed round, and all hands<lb/>
should rub each others&#x0027; shoulder-blades, and be<lb/>
content.</p>
<p>Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because<lb/>
they make a point of paying me for my trouble,<lb/>
whereas they never pay passengers a single penny<lb/>
that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers<lb/>
themselves must pay: and there is all the differ-<lb/>
ence in the world between paying and being paid.<lb/>
The urbane activity with which a man receives<lb/>
money is really marvellous, considering that we<lb/>
so earnestly believe money to be the root of all<lb/>
earthly ills, and that on no account can a monied<lb/>
man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we con-<lb/>
sign ourselves to perdition!</p>
<p>Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because<lb/>
of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the<lb/>
forecastle deck. For as in this world, head winds<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n25" n="8"/>
are far more prevalent than winds from astern<lb/>
(that is, if you never violate the Pythagorean<lb/>
maxim), so for the most part the Commodore on<lb/>
the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second<lb/>
hand from the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks<lb/>
he breathes it first; but not so. In much the<lb/>
same way do the commonalty lead their leaders<lb/>
in many other things, at the same time that the<lb/>
leaders little suspect it. But wherefore it was that<lb/>
after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a mer-<lb/>
chant sailor, I should now take it into my head to<lb/>
go on a whaling voyage; this the invisible police<lb/>
officer of the Fates, who has the constant sur-<lb/>
veillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and in-<lb/>
fluences me in some unaccountable way&#x2014;he can<lb/>
better answer than any one else. I take it that<lb/>
this part of the bill, of those three mysterious<lb/>
ladies, must have run something like this:</p>
<quote>
<p><hi rend="i">&#x201C;Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States.</hi></p>
<p>&#x201C;WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL.</p>
<p>&#x201C;BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.&#x201D;</p>
</quote>
<p>Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that<lb/>
those stage managers, the Fates, put me down for<lb/>
this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others<lb/>
were set down for magnificent parts in high<lb/>
tragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n26" n="9"/>
comedies, and jolly parts in farces&#x2014;though I<lb/>
cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that<lb/>
I recal all the circumstances, I think I can see a<lb/>
little into the springs and motives which, being<lb/>
cunningly presented to me under various disguises,<lb/>
induced me to set about performing the part I did,<lb/>
besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was<lb/>
a choice resulting from my own unbiassed free-will<lb/>
and discriminating judgment.</p>
<p>Chief among these motives was the overwhelm-<lb/>
ing idea of the great whale himself. Such a<lb/>
portentous and mysterious monster roused all my<lb/>
curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where<lb/>
he rolled his island bulk; the undeliverable,<lb/>
nameless perils of the whale; these, with all the<lb/>
attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights<lb/>
and sounds, helped to sway me to my wish. With<lb/>
other men, perhaps, such things would not have<lb/>
been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented<lb/>
with an everlasting itch for things remote. I love<lb/>
to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous<lb/>
coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to<lb/>
perceive a horror, and could still be social with<lb/>
it&#x2014;would they let me&#x2014;since it is but well to be on<lb/>
friendly terms with all the inmates of the place<lb/>
one lodges in.</p>
<p>By reason of these things, then, the whaling<lb/>
voyage was welcome; the great flood-gates of the<lb/>
wonder-world swung open, and in the wild con-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n27" n="10"/>
ceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two<lb/>
there floated into my inmost soul, endless pro-<lb/>
cessions of the whale, and, midmost of them all,<lb/>
one grand hooded phantom, like a snow-hill in<lb/>
the air.</p>
