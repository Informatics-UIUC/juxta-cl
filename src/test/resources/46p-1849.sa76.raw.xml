                    <head>Introduction</head>
                    <p>This story is one of the most important Rossettian and Pre-Raphaelite
                        documents treating ideas of art and aesthetics. DGR was well aware of the
                        work's programmatic&#8212;or as he called it, &#8220;metaphysical&#8221;&#8212;character (see  <bibl>
                     <author>Fredeman</author>, <xref doc="a.">
                        <hi rend="i">
                           <title level="bk">Correspondence</title>
                        </hi>
                     </xref>,  <pages>54. 63 and 57. 36</pages>
                  </bibl>). The date of the work's composition (1849) and the character of its
                        fictional materials (mid- to late thirteenth-century) define it as a
                        manifesto of early Pre-Raphaelitism. But DGR had no difficulty revising it
                        twenty years later so that it could function in a similar way under very
                        different circumstances, at least with respect to his own work. As <xref doc="a.englnotes.001.rad" link="dead">Bentley</xref> and <xref doc="a.nx547.6.r67r53.rad" link="dead">Riede</xref> have clearly shown, when DGR revised
                        early materials (like this story) at a later point, and in particular in the
                        crucial years 1869-1870, his revisions were in part designed to ensure that
                        his works would not be read in a narrow, institutionally religious point of
                        view. This kind of reading of his work was (and still is) an available
                        option precisely because Pre-Raphaelitism developed in the same context that
                        produced the Tractarian Movement and the (Anglo-)Catholic revival.</p>
                    <p>But DGR was never inclined to institutional religion, however much his work
                        is rightly seen as fueled by his sympathies with religious ideas, and
                        especially with mystical religious ideas. Furthermore, his fascination with
                        medieval religious culture and its institutions must not be taken as
                        evidence of a fideist inclination. On the contrary, it is&#8212;as it
                        was with Ruskin and Morris&#8212;an index of an historicist
                        imagination. DGR's historicism, however, is distinct, even idiosyncratic.
                            <title level="wrk">&#8220;Hand and Soul&#8221;</title> is the
                        work that most clearly defines Rossetti's way of constellating his
                        committments to art, religious devotion, and a thoroughly secular historicism.</p>
                    <p>First of all one wants to note the self-conscious use of style in the prose.
                        The narrator is as much an historicist construction as is Chiaro, and both
                        are clear surrogates for DGR&#8212;the one a contemporary surrogate,
                        the other his thirteenth-century precursor. In drawing the two into a
                        sympathetic relation, the story literally enacts, at the narrative level,
                        the historicist argument it is proposing. This argument, however, is
                        crucially modified by the religious and specifically devotional character of
                        both men. The story's prologue and epilogue show that the narrator's primary
                        interest in Chiaro's art is defined by the art's religious commitments. The
                        story makes its own committment not simply to a humanist &#8220;art for
                        art's sake&#8221;, but to &#8220;<quote>painters . . . who feared
                            God and loved the art</quote>&#8221;. This ideal explains the
                        epilogue's satiric treatment of the continental students, who take a secular
                        and rationalist approach to art. Worse still, so far as the story represents
                        the matter, is their smug humanist self-assurance that they know how to look
                        at and judge works of art.</p>
                    <p>DGR's historicism, however, works against the humanist grain that is its
                        customary accompaniment. It is, in this respect, much closer to the
                        historicism of a Walter Benjamin than of a Georg Hegel. The principal aim of
                            <title level="wrk" rend="i">&#8220;Hand and
                        Soul&#8221;</title> is to show how &#8220;<quote>individual
                            artists might learn to bring their work into line with the
                                &#8216;<hi rend="i">purpose of fortune</hi>
                        </quote>&#8217;&#8221; postulated in the story.</p>
                    <p>The climactic speech of Chiaro's soul defines the artistic program. It argues
                        that the artist must practise a devotional art, and that the object of this
                        devotion must be &#8220;God&#8221;, that is to say, something
                        beyond what DGR's contemporary related poem, <title level="wrk" rend="i">
                            <xref doc="a.2-1849.s102.raw">&#8220;St. Luke the Painter&#8221;</xref>
                        </title>, calls &#8220;<quote>soulless self-reflections of man's
                        skill</quote>&#8221;. This God is a <hi rend="i">
                     <foreign rend="i" lang="latin">deus
                        absconditus</foreign>
                  </hi>, however, which is why DGR's program, like his work,
                        is shot through with mystical elements. Chiaro's soul makes its
                        case&#8212;and appears on the scene&#8212;at the nadir of Chiaro's
                        spiritual desolation. That dark moment is the key to the whole story, as to
                        its program. It is the moment when Chiaro realizes, through his own
                        self-examination, that one &#8220;<quote>May . . . be a devil and not
                            know it</quote>&#8221;. At this moment the core of every humanist
                        faith is being overthrown: in effect, Chiaro has discovered that
                        self-knowledge is not a light to display and dispel ideology and
                        superstition, it is itself a deep&#8212;perhaps the
                        deepest&#8212;superstition. One recalls the profound Byronic insight
                        that came to dominate so much of European thought, especially the thought of
                        Baudelaire, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche: <cit>&#8220;<quote>The tree of
                                knowledge is not that of life</quote>&#8221; (<bibl>

                    <p>But <title level="wrk" rend="i">&#8220;Hand and Soul&#8221;</title>
                        does not ground itself in that kind of heroic self-criticism. When Chiaro's
                        soul tells him that he must &#8220;<quote>Set thine hand to serve man
                            with God</quote>&#8221;, he is being enjoined to a worldly art that
                        is executed in a spirit of humility and devotion. Italian primitive art is
                        notable to DGR and his narrator for its devotional attitude toward its
                        materials, i.e., its religious subjects. The latter are among the most
                        &#8220;worldly&#8221; subjects to those primitive painters simply
                        because the most quotidian features of their world were religious. The
                        contemporary application would be to strive for a
                        &#8220;faithful&#8221; (in both senses) representation of the
                        world, including the immediate historical world, not as it should or might
                        be, but as it is or appears to one's unmonitored consciousness. The
                        Pre-Raphaelite term for this attitude was often &#8220;<quote>truth to
                        Nature</quote>&#8221;, where &#8220;Nature&#8221; stood for
                        an <hi rend="i">unvarnished</hi> (in several senses) pictorial representation.</p>
                    <p>But there is another, resolutely idealistic side to this matter that appears
                        in the climax of the soul's speech to Chiaro. The soul's argument to Chiaro
                        is that he will &#8220;<quote>serve
                        man</quote>&#8221;&#8212;that is to say, perform a useful social
                        function with his art&#8212;only if that art is wholly devotional and
                        committed to the revelation of spiritual realities. The soul's argument is
                        that Chiaro must humble himself and make his art at once a figure and a

                        that the successful American reprint must have reaffirmed DGR's own

                        </quote>.&#8221; The period of DGR's story is earlier, as the epigraph
                        from Bonaggiunta Urbiciana suggests, and as the reference to Giunta Pisano
                        makes certain; specifically, it is the mid- to late thirteenth-century when
                        Italian art is on the brink of the Renaissance. Giotto has not yet appeared,
                        indeed (according to the story), even Cimabue is only just coming into
                        public prominence. The point of all this is to encourage the reader to make
                        a mental act of art historical recovery: that is, not only to try to imagine
                        this primitive cultural scene, but to realize it in Vasarian terms. For
                        DGR's tale, in the end, is an effort to rethink art history <hi rend="i">outside of the humanist paradigm that Vasari's </hi>

                        take the Renaissance road. As such, it is a story with a profound
                        contemporary (mid-Victorian) message. It is a message that in certain
                        respects anticipates a similar refusal made by programmatic Modernist artists.</p>

                        Pre-Raphaelite ballads and other works, written in a pastiche style. The
                        latter is no mere rhetorical affectation. It represents a fundamental moral
                        and aesthetic feature of the Pre-Raphaelite program, which attempted a kind
                        of resurrection of certain cultural and spiritual values it associated with
                        late Medieval art and society. The act of pastiche was for DGR, and probably
                        for Morris as well, a sign that a contemporary work was aspiring to carry
                        out, in a secular age, a transcendentalizing spiritual act equivalent to the
                        devotional acts they saw executed in primitive European art and poetry.</p>

                    <p>Although formally a work of fiction, the story has always (and rightly) been
                        taken as DGR's artistic manifesto. In this respect the work's
                        autobiographical character must be acknowledged, with Chiaro being DGR's
                        alter ego in the tale. Morse argues that Giunta Pisano is Ford Madox Brown,
                        and that the <foreign rend="i" lang="latin">&#8220;figura
                        mistica&#8221;</foreign> painting of the tale is a watercolor DGR
                        executed between March and August 1848, before he wrote his story. The
                        latter two identifications are perhaps unwontedly specific; nonetheless,
                        they correctly signal the intensely personal character of DGR's story.</p>
