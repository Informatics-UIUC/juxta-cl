===============================================================================

Synopsis
--------

JuxtaCL is a specialized form of Juxta. It is a command-line tool that accepts
the path to two files a parameters. It will collate them and return their
change index (degree of difference between the two files).

Requirements
------------
Java 1.6+
Maven 3.x

Build
-----
JuxtaCL is built by maven. Execute: mvn package

Usage
-----
Once built, the binary distribution can be found in the target directory.
It will be named: juxta-{version}-bin.tar.gz.
Expand this archive and move into the top level directory. It contains
a script for launching JuxtaCL named juxta.sh. It accepts the following
command line arguments:

-help                   - displays usage information
-version                - prints the JuxtaCL version
-strip <file>           - takes one XML file and strips out the tag content. 
                           This content is streamed to std:out
-diff <a> <b> [options] - <a> and <b> are the two files to compare. [options]
                          is the set of config options for the comparison.

                           [ juxta |                      to determine percent
                             levenshtein |                differnece betweenn the

diff.sh takes 2 files. The change index (as calculated with Juxta algorigthm) is returned.
The -algorithm paramter is also accepted.

all.sh takes 2 file parameters. It will return a table of change indexes, one
row for each algorithm.
